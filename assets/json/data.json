Despite this youthfulness, a significant portion of the young labor force is neither in education nor any form of employment. The employment landscape in Uganda is shifting, with a growing emphasis on soft skills. According to a 2022 report by the Federation of Uganda Employers and the International Labour Organization, 80% of employers now prioritize skills such as innovation, problem-solving, and teamwork. Annually, over 400,000 individuals graduate from higher education institutions in Uganda, yet an estimated 280,000 find themselves unemployed or underemployed. This highlights a critical mismatch between the skills taught in educational institutions and those required by employers. The demand for 21st-century skills is rapidly increasing as the job market evolves. According to UNICEF, young people in Uganda must navigate a transforming world where technology, migration, climate change, and rapidly changing job markets are reshaping society. Despite this, many adolescents and youth lack essential skills such as innovation, critical thinking, communication, creativity, teamwork, and collaboration."
